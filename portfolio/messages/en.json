To achieve this, I implemented an API Gateway using Kong, integrated with Consul as a DNS resolver to map microservice IPs, making service registration and communication easier. Additionally, I used Ubuntu Server, Docker, and Docker Compose for containerization. I also maintain existing projects, including a chatbot for the Municipality of Corumbá-MS** and software for reading and digitizing pieces of Pantanal culture.",
