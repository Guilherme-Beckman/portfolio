To achieve this, I implemented an API Gateway using Kong, integrated with Consul as a DNS resolver to map microservice IPs, making service registration and communication easier. Additionally, I used Ubuntu Server, Docker, and Docker Compose for containerization. I also maintain existing projects, including a chatbot for the Municipality of Corumbá-MS** and software for reading and digitizing pieces of Pantanal culture.",

The platform addresses a fundamental challenge in accounting operations: ensuring faithful representation of operational reality through automated document validation and inconsistency detection. It processes multi-format accounting documents — PDF, Excel, and CSV — and applies a structured rules engine with over 284 validation rules to detect errors, warnings, and alerts across balance sheets and general ledgers. Each rule is categorized by severity level and mapped to specific account classifications, enabling auditors to focus on high-impact issues first. The rules engine is driven by CSV configuration files rather than hardcoded logic, making it possible for domain experts to add, modify, or disable rules without code changes. I chose Spring Data JDBC over JPA deliberately — the validation workload is read-heavy and batch-oriented, where raw SQL performance and explicit query control outweigh the convenience of ORM abstractions.",

      "description": "Building the rules engine for ACTUS surfaced a natural question: could we automate the creation of validation rules themselves? I developed a standalone AI-powered system that generates structured accounting rules using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), combining domain-specific knowledge from Brazilian CPC accounting pronouncements with the reasoning capabilities of large language models. The system produces 200–300 validated rules per execution in a structured CSV format, ready to be consumed directly by the ACTUS rules engine. Each rule includes account classification codes (with wildcard support), validation logic, severity levels, configurable parameters, and regulatory justification. The pipeline consists of three sequential stages: automated CPC pronouncement collection, semantic vectorization with ChromaDB, and structured rule generation via Google Gemini 2.0 Flash. I initially built the system on Anthropic's Claude API but migrated to Gemini for cost efficiency — the free tier covers full pipeline executions at zero cost. The architecture is designed for extensibility: account categories, truth sources, and LLM backends are all configurable via YAML.",
