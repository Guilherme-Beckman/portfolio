    "ifmsDescription": "Worked at LIADS in the infrastructure area, with the responsibility of configuring a server from scratch (on-premise), where the architecture was designed to support Microservices. To achieve this, I implemented an API Gateway using Kong, integrated with Consul as a DNS resolver to map microservice IPs, making service registration and communication easier. Additionally, I used Ubuntu Server, Docker, and Docker Compose for containerization. I also maintain existing projects, including a chatbot for the Municipality of Corumb치-MS** and software for reading and digitizing pieces of Pantanal culture."
